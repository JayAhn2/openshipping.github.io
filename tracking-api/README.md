# OpenShipping.org Tracking API

The *Tracking API* provides querying functionality for getting shipping status, targeted answering common industry tracking requests. Data publishers include carriers and other shipping actors, as well as data aggregation service providers. Data consumers are mainly beneficiary cargo owners, shippers, consignees and similar customers with a need to track cargo movements. 

The corresponding OpenAPI .yaml file for the Tracking API can be found here: [tracking-api.yaml](tracking-api.yaml). The same is also on SwaggerHub here: [https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/OpenShippingDotOrg/OpenShipping-TrackingAPI](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/OpenShippingDotOrg/OpenShipping-TrackingAPI).

## Background
The Tracking API was developed in continuation of the OpenShipping.org [Event API](https://github.com/OpenShipping/openshipping.github.io/tree/master/event-api). It is a natural continuation of the data model of the Event API, based on the exact same data model and event model, essentially just changed to serve request/reply (`GET`) tracking use cases instead of stateless event publishing (`POST`). While strongly related, they are individual stand alone APIs, serving quite different use cases. Thus, parts of the documentation is consciously repeated between these two specifications.

### UN/CEFACT Foundation
![UNCEFACT Buy-Ship-Pay](images/cefact-bsp.png)
The Tracking API allows retrieving Consignments and Transport Equipment tracking statuses. These are direct implementations of the Consignment and Transport Equipment classes of the UN/CEFACT Supply Chain Reference Data Model (SCRDM)’s Buy-Ship-Pay model, which is to be considered the semantic reference model for this API. 

A *Consignment* represents the contracted movement of goods and the Transport Equipment used for that transport. From the perspective of common carrier business processes, the Consignment roughly represents the booking confirmation and/or a bill of lading (in cases where they differ). Please note that Consignment is to be distinguished from "shipment", which refers to the traded goods. These semantics are often a bit blurry, carriers traditionally have not have a reason to distinguish. Throughout the API semantics are adopted directly from the UN/CEFACT SCRDM Buy-Ship-Pay model, emphasizing this distinction between Trade Data (yellow) and Transport Data (blue). 

*Transport Equipment* in our context can be considered a container. Particularly, it represents the equipment matching, when a physically identified container has been assigned to the consignment.  The relation to a Consignment is important: since the same physical container is reused over and over, it is the Transport Equipment within a Consignment which is relevant to a given set of shipping parties. 

Shipment plays an important role, but has not yet been included in this first version of the API entirely due to scope confinement. The Shipment class represents the traded of goods inside the containers, and are of important relevance to authorities, financial institutions, sellers and sellers. It is worth noting that LCL tracking should be done through the Shipment class, so the current version of the API is only meant to deal with FCL. We consider adding the Shipment class a natural future extension of the API. 

Movement and Means are implemented in the Milestone events. Both are represented in the resource model, available through the Milestone event endpoints. 

### Additional Adopted Standards
* **UN/CEFACT Smart Container project under transports and logistics** for tracking and monitoring physical trip execution, implemented in the SmartEvent endpoints. 
* **UN/CEFACT Code List recommendation 24**, supported through the generic events. 
* **UN/Locode**, implemented at attribute level for geographical locations
* **SMDG**, implemented at attribute level for terminal identification
* **IMO**, implemented at attribute level vessel identification
* **ISO 8601**, implemented at attribute level for time and timezone representation
* **ISO 6346**, implemented at attribute level for container identification

## Resource Model
```
GET /consignments/{consignmentRef}
GET /transportEquipment/{equipmentNumber}
```
The Tracking API exposes two endpoints, representing the `Consignment` and `TransportEquipment` resources. Note that the Tracking API is intended to be used as resource reference in linked data contexts for Consignment and Transport Equipment. 

In the response to these requests is returned a list of various kinds of events, which come in three flavors: planned, estimated and actual. They are related in the following manner: 

![Class Overview](images/class-overview.png)

By and large, the industry plans at the Consignment level (meaning the plan is the same for all containers), and very often the individual container cannot be identified until a while after the plan is issued. This is represented by *Planned Events*, which are thus bundled into a full Consignment transport plan. 

By contrast, *Actual Events* are physical occurrences of the individual, identified containers. A container is gated in, not a Consignment. Thus, Actual Events relate to Transport Equipment. 

The same is the case for *Estimated Events*, which are operational expected occurrences such as ETAs and ETDs. This is different from a plan: a delay may render a plan invalid, but it doesn't automatically update that plan to a new one. 

## Event Model
The returned lists of events are further subdivided based on a logical model, which is introduced in this section. 

### Where Events Occur
![Event Occurances](images/where-events-occur.png)
* All Milestone events occur within a defined location (UNLOCODE location and SMDG Terminal). 
* Smart Events occur continuously along each leg (GPS Coordinates), between locations.
* Generic Events may not relate to any kind of location at all.

### Milestone Events

#### Milestone Event Introduction
The Milestone events are modular, and can model any Consignment’s multi-modal transport plan. This reflects the various locations which the Equipment needs to moving move between for contractual and operational purposes. 
![Event Model Locations](images/event-model-locations.png)

Equipment is moved between locations by various means of transport. Such “legs” can be considered the edges connecting location nodes.  
![Milestone Event Legs](images/event-model-legs.png)

Each leg are represented consistently as four distinct, key milestone events representing how containers are first *loaded*, then *departs* from one location, *arrives* at a different location, and is *discharged* from that means of transport. This cycle is repeated for each leg of the transport plan. 
![Milestone Event Events](images/event-model-events.png)

Through the journey, the container changes status, from *export* to *import*, and *empty* to *full* and then again *empty*. These statuses are represented as attributes on the events. 
![Milestone Event Attributes](images/event-model-attr.png)

Finally, each event comes in three types: *planned*, representing how the carrier intends to carry out the transport, *estimated*, which can be signaled along the way (not shown below), and *actual*, when the milestone event has been carried out. 
![Milestone Event Types](images/event-model-types.png)

#### Milestone Event Model

A transport plan Leg is described by four events: 
* Load
* Departure
* Arrival 
* Discharge

Each, in turn, come in three flavors: 
* Planned – what is supposed to happen
* Estimated – what and when events are expected to happen
* Actual – what has indeed happened

This results in 12 distinct events per leg type: 
![Events Per Leg](images/events-per-leg.png)

Legs are joined together to form a full transport plan. Leg-joining happens at terminals.
![Linked Events](images/linked-events.png) 
Note that Planned events relate to Consignments, whereas Estimates and Actuals relate to Equipment. This reflects that carriers plans for the full consignment, but containers are in reality moved individually. 

There are individual events for each type of leg: 
* Truck 
* Rail
* Barge
* Vessel
The event model thus consists of a total of 48 events: 
![All Milestone Events](images/all-milestone-events.png) 
This model is easily extensible (e.g. adding an “Air” leg type). 

While the milestone event model is based on this strict logical, where appropriate the naming of individual events are made to embrace common industry lingo. E.g. “Gate out” instead of ”Truck departure”.
